You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook / 
You can use the Google Colaboratory for the model building and testing.

Get the datasets from the kaggle.com site and all the datasets used are properly verified which have been used to make particular models.

Diiferent concepts of the ML have been used for Regression and Classification problems using Neural Networks and Deep Learning concepts.
Different models have been made to get the basic idea of the day-to-day life situations and focus purely on learning new things from it.
